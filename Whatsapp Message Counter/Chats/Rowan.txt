2024/06/05, 22:25 - Rowan: A funny little furry that lives south of rasmodius, he sells hats
2024/06/05, 22:30 - Aidan: Y
2024/06/05, 22:30 - Aidan: Also is there a better way to make money?
2024/06/05, 22:31 - Rowan: Because they dont really get you any money until you develop them
2024/06/05, 22:31 - Rowan: At least from my experience
2024/06/05, 22:31 - Rowan: Fishing, crops and extra gems were my main sources of money
2024/06/05, 22:32 - Rowan: Idk if you're alr past the egg festival but what I usually do is save up all my money until the festival comes and plant strawberries
2024/06/05, 22:32 - Rowan: Those are my first spring cash crop
2024/06/05, 22:32 - Rowan: They're really valuable so they're good money ;u;
2024/06/05, 22:34 - Aidan: Yes we are
2024/06/05, 22:39 - Rowan: Ah i see, alr
2024/06/05, 22:39 - Rowan: Then kale or cauliflowers will probably get you the most money
2024/06/05, 22:39 - Rowan: Well actually I think kale's for xp but it's still the most lucrative option
2024/06/05, 22:40 - Rowan: Potatoes are p good too
2024/06/05, 22:40 - Rowan: But anyways, it doesn't really matter in the end if you're chilling, these are just speed strategies 💀
2024/06/05, 22:40 - Rowan: Do what the vibe wants
2024/06/05, 22:40 - Rowan: But anyways, my eyelids are shutting, ima go sleep
2024/06/05, 22:41 - Rowan: Good nighty

2024/07/03, 13:42 - Aidan: yk what I mean 😭
2024/07/03, 13:42 - Rowan: i didn't actually, that was a wild acronym for assignment <This message was edited>
2024/07/03, 13:42 - Rowan: 💀💀
2024/07/03, 13:42 - Aidan: ikik
2024/07/03, 13:42 - Aidan: but like
2024/07/03, 13:42 - Aidan: some code uses it as a acronym'
2024/07/03, 13:42 - Aidan: lol
2024/07/03, 13:43 - Aidan: like in .ass
2024/07/03, 13:43 - Aidan: lol
2024/07/03, 13:43 - Rowan: thats crazy
2024/07/03, 13:43 - Rowan: they just did that to be funny, there's no way they couldn't have used "task" instead
2024/07/03, 13:43 - Rowan: 😭
2024/07/03, 13:43 - Rowan: or well, .ass would stand for assign i think
2024/07/03, 13:44 - Aidan: o ye
2024/07/03, 13:44 - Rowan: so a better word would be "allocate" so the acronym could be "allo" or "all" if you wanna be really ambiguous
2024/07/03, 13:45 - Rowan: or task could still work ig, it does work as a verb sometimes <This message was edited>
2024/07/03, 13:45 - Rowan: but anyway, im speaking yapanese frfr
2024/07/03, 13:46 - Aidan: lmao
2024/07/03, 13:46 - Aidan: wyd in eng?

2024/07/03, 14:02 - Aidan: why
2024/07/03, 14:02 - Aidan: ?
2024/07/03, 14:18 - Rowan: idk these pieces im writing are not eating
2024/07/03, 14:23 - Aidan: lol
2024/07/03, 14:24 - Rowan: its just a result of the assignment ig
2024/07/03, 14:24 - Rowan: when you ask a critter to write 13 desc pieces at once with a vague prompt the quality is bound to be lower
2024/07/03, 14:24 - Rowan: at least, that's what i tell myself 😍🙏
2024/07/04, 16:43 - Rowan: This message was deleted
2024/07/04, 16:43 - Rowan: might be the jankiest code ive ever written
2024/07/04, 16:43 - Rowan: also, good afternoon/evenig
2024/07/04, 16:43 - Rowan: idk, is 4pm evening? I think it is sometimes but its not giving evening today
2024/07/04, 16:43 - Rowan: but anyway
2024/07/04, 17:00 - Rowan: wait omw theres so many problems with what I sent

2024/07/08, 12:19 - Aidan: wait wat :D
2024/07/08, 12:19 - Aidan: what subject code?
2024/07/08, 12:19 - Rowan: Cambridge assigns all their subjects subject codes and you need to know them for exam shenanigans
2024/07/08, 12:19 - Rowan: I haven't learnt them this year yet so im just getting that done
2024/07/08, 12:20 - Aidan: what are codes?
2024/07/08, 12:20 - Rowan: for the subjects im doing:
physics - 0625
cs - 0478
AS English - 9093
AS Afrikaans - 8679
2024/07/08, 12:20 - Aidan: ooooh
2024/07/08, 12:20 - Aidan: makes sense
2024/07/08, 12:21 - Rowan: for math its 0581, normal eng 0500 (I think, im not sure), for chem I think it was 0620 and then idek normal afr
2024/07/08, 12:21 - Aidan: what are they used for?
2024/07/08, 12:22 - Rowan: for registering for exams and you need them at the exam venue
2024/07/08, 12:23 - Rowan: subjects have multiple variations so you need your subject code to make sure you're writing the correct variation of said subject
2024/07/08, 12:28 - Aidan: ooh
2024/07/08, 16:03 - Aidan: Yoo

2024/07/22, 15:04 - Rowan: Good evening parents. This is a rough planning in terms of the revision till the exam. The program will obviously be adapted depending the needs of the students.
The students will from this week onward get a weekly revision sheets that will be available on Sunday night so that they can start early the Monday morning. I have tried to break down the week's revision in daily chunks. It is just an indication and each student can adapt it to his needs and time available.  The revision sheet will be uploaded under the Game Plan heading.
2024/07/22, 15:05 - Rowan: Student will also het a theory and an practical paper for homework every week from now on. The papers will be under the Practical and Theory revision. 
The Monday Last Scenario questions recordings will be uploaded in a section dedicated for it.
Students are also encourage to watch the videos under the Programming Toolbelt
There is a lesson on Wednesdays at 11:00 for the core group (that started January) any of the other students are also welcome to attend those lessons. We will do further questions on that day (see planning) however these lessons will be recorded and available under the Online recordings if your child can not make that slot.
Please do not hesitate to contact me should your child experience any problems.

2024/09/30, 19:21 - Rowan: 💀 💀
2024/09/30, 19:21 - Aidan: Why?
2024/09/30, 19:22 - Rowan: Idk it's not a very good anime, but it's enjoyable
2024/09/30, 19:22 - Aidan: Huh
2024/09/30, 19:22 - Rowan: Like the characters are 1-dimensional, fight scenes are mediocre, character development is sporadic and inconsistent, art style is ok but not enough to support the lack in narrative quality
2024/09/30, 19:23 - Rowan: My friend really likes it though so I'm just waiting for when it gets good
2024/09/30, 19:23 - Aidan: Oo
2024/09/30, 19:23 - Rowan: But girl we 18 eps in and I ain't seen nothing 💀🙏
2024/09/30, 19:23 - Aidan: Oh
2024/09/30, 19:23 - Aidan: Bruh have you heard of the rule of 3?
2024/09/30, 19:24 - Rowan: I have and I normally follow it
2024/09/30, 19:24 - Rowan: But like one piece doesn't follow that rule so I thought maybe that was the case here
2024/09/30, 19:24 - Rowan: Like op took like 30 eps to get going 😭😭😭
2024/09/30, 19:25 - Aidan: Dang
2024/09/30, 19:26 - Rowan: And even then it had rough patches
2024/09/30, 19:26 - Rowan: Like fishman arc? I was disrespected, can't believe I found the strength to finish it 💀💀
2024/09/30, 19:26 - Rowan: Took me like 6 damn months of on and off watching
2024/09/30, 19:27 - Rowan: The arc where they recruited usopp was also p kak, villain was weak as hell and nami was still annoying

2024/09/30, 19:44 - Aidan: Legit the main guy's brother is training to run, then he says "imaging a big black man is chasing you" then the guy slows down and he says "well at least he is not racist" 💀💀💀

2024/10/01, 09:55 - Rowan: rowan stares blankly at his screen, yet behind those eyes a turmoil unbound broils within his soul; his bitchass is almost broke. can he truly afford to spend 230 rand on hitman at this moment? or must he be resolute and wait for something that requires more important funding? the fates play in his hands like a dandelion in the breeze. what will he do?

Tomorrow *30 September 9:00* - Last Scenario question
*Thursday 11:00 till 12:30* - Theory and practical paper revision
All lessons will be recorded.
I will be giving feedback from marked papers this week - I will start giving feedback from the most resent papers handed in. Apologies for not being able to mark all papers - I was busy with exam workshops and invigilation last week. I will try and catch up this week.

2024/10/02, 10:55 - Aidan: Firmware
2024/10/02, 10:55 - Aidan: Like
2024/10/02, 10:56 - Aidan: Tis a program that is embeded in hardware
2024/10/02, 10:56 - Aidan: Like the os of a calculator
2024/10/02, 10:56 - Rowan: o I see
2024/10/02, 10:56 - Aidan: Yea
2024/10/02, 10:56 - Rowan: ok, and can you explain the fde cycle to me lmaoo
2024/10/02, 10:56 - Rowan: ma'am's powerpoint did not help me at all
2024/10/02, 10:57 - Aidan: Um
2024/10/02, 10:58 - Aidan: This cycle consists of the 'fetch' phase which retrieves an instruction, the 'decode' phase which analyses the instruction, and the 'execute' phase where the CPU performs the command.
2024/10/02, 10:58 - Rowan: i know that, but how do the registers work
2024/10/02, 10:58 - Rowan: like what is the order of operations with the registers
2024/10/02, 10:59 - Aidan: Wha
2024/10/02, 10:59 - Aidan: What is the q u struggling wit?
2024/10/02, 10:59 - Rowan: like does the PC send the address to MAR, then data in MAR address is sent to where?? IS IT THE RAM OR THE MDR?? MAKE UP YO MIND
2024/10/02, 10:59 - Aidan: Ok so
2024/10/02, 10:59 - Aidan: The fetch-decode-execute cycle is followed by a processor to process an instruction. The cycle consists of several stages.

The 
memory
 address held in the program counter is copied into the MAR.
The address in the program counter is then incremented (increased) by one. The program counter now holds the address of the next instruction to be fetched.
The processor sends a signal along the 
address bus
 to the memory address held in the MAR.
The instruction/data held in that memory address is sent along the data bus to the MDR.
The instruction/data held in the MDR is copied into the CIR.
The instruction/data held in the CIR is decoded and then executed. Results of processing are stored in the ACC.
The cycle then returns to step one.
Depending on the type of instruction, additional steps may be taken:

If the instruction is to transfer data held in the ACC back to primary memory, the intended memory address is copied into the MAR. The data to be transferred is copied into the MDR and then transferred to the specified address using the address bus and data bus.
The executed instruction may require the program to jump to a different place in the program. In this case, the memory address of the new next instruction to be fetched is copied into the program counter. The process then restarts at step one.
2024/10/02, 11:00 - Rowan: it's not a specific question, i just don't know the order that the registers are used in the cycle
2024/10/02, 11:00 - Aidan: Oh
2024/10/02, 11:00 - Rowan: so then where does RAM come in?? was it a fever dream that i had where the RAM played any part in this 😭😭
2024/10/02, 11:01 - Aidan: Ym
2024/10/02, 11:01 - Aidan: Um
2024/10/02, 11:01 - Aidan: Uh

2024/10/02, 11:01 - Rowan: 😭😭
2024/10/02, 11:01 - Rowan: well thanks for the help, this cleared stuff up
2024/10/02, 11:02 - Rowan: ima just assume that the voice in my head screaming "RAM RAM RAM RAM RAM" truly is just insane and move on

2024/10/03, 11:02 - Aidan: lmao
2024/10/03, 11:04 - Aidan: npnp
2024/10/03, 11:07 - Aidan: man
2024/10/03, 11:07 - Aidan: this feels wrong
2024/10/03, 11:07 - Aidan: <Media omitted>
2024/10/03, 11:07 - Rowan: i-
2024/10/03, 11:07 - Aidan: should it not be "The contents of the array is outputted"?
2024/10/03, 11:08 - Rowan: no?? 💀💀
2024/10/03, 11:08 - Aidan: Why no?
2024/10/03, 11:08 - Rowan: that's grammatically wrong
2024/10/03, 11:08 - Rowan: output is also past perfect tense
2024/10/03, 11:08 - Aidan: contents of the array (singular) is outputted?
2024/10/03, 11:08 - Aidan: ok fair
2024/10/03, 11:08 - Aidan: but is
2024/10/03, 11:08 - Aidan: not are?
2024/10/03, 11:08 - Rowan: no?
2024/10/03, 11:08 - Rowan: contents is a plural
2024/10/03, 11:10 - Aidan: yes but

contents of the arrays are
contents of the array is
?
2024/10/03, 11:10 - Rowan: no, are is correct xdd
2024/10/03, 11:10 - Rowan: "contents of the array" is the object, the object isn't just "the array"
2024/10/03, 11:10 - Rowan: and since the object is plural, the article is are
2024/10/03, 11:11 - Rowan: if it was just "the array" then id agree with you, but in this case no lmao
2024/10/03, 11:14 - Aidan: Okok fair
2024/10/03, 11:41 - Rowan: remember when 5 minutes ago ma'am talked about a homeschooler kid with a weird accent and he was talking about there being "hordes and hordes" of people
2024/10/03, 11:41 - Rowan: well i tried to find what accent he could've been from so i looked on google for vernaculars that include "hordes" in it
2024/10/03, 11:41 - Rowan: but i didn't find anything
2024/10/03, 11:42 - Rowan: so then i checked the word's etymology but it seems to originate from like Kazakhstan/Mongolia and i severely doubt that accent could be mistaken for irish, + it was a historical usage so its outdated
2024/10/03, 11:43 - Rowan: i also saw some sources of its usage over the past 500 years that looked british, which is more reasonable, and from a logical but not necessarily evident perspective i could see hordes in a british vernacular <This message was edited>
2024/10/03, 11:43 - Rowan: (can you tell how flipping bored i am)
2024/10/03, 11:50 - Aidan: lmao why?

2024/10/09, 11:28 - Rowan: ye, that's right
2024/10/09, 11:29 - Rowan: basically in that method you just swap each bit and then add 1 to the number

2024/10/09, 11:29 - Aidan: like 01
2024/10/09, 11:29 - Rowan: so like, 00110011 becomes 11001100, and then with add 1 that becomes 11001101
2024/10/09, 11:30 - Aidan: oh ok

2024/10/12, 10:24 - Aidan: <Media omitted>
2024/10/12, 10:26 - Aidan: Except add 2 more ppl and add 1 other 3rd party. Person 5 will try get the download, but it will say like 5 days download time. Then fitgirl will come and compress the file and upload it, person 5 and 6 will get it and unpack it. So basically repacks are for people with bad wifi. So you download 20gb but then unpack it to be like 60
2024/10/12, 10:26 - Aidan: Pretty cool
2024/10/12, 10:58 - Rowan: 💀

2024/10/14, 08:23 - Aidan: Gmgm
2024/10/14, 11:12 - Aidan: Ig i could just tell you so long lol.

So steam family share is quite cool actually. Basically you connect 2 accounts and you can "borrow" the other person's games. So if, for example, i don't have TABS but you do, i can download it and play it on my acc, but if you start plaing it, i get a message saying to save and shut down cause you are playing and after 5 min if i havent i get kicked out. So basically we share games but thr actual owner gets priority lol
2024/10/14, 11:38 - Rowan: sounds cool, we should look into itt
2024/10/14, 12:12 - Aidan: Yup that's what i was thinking lol
2024/10/14, 12:50 - Aidan: Yo. Thought I'd let you know. There is bible study Friday

2024/10/14, 13:42 - Rowan: okk thanks
2024/10/14, 15:11 - Aidan: Ok so:

Pros:
Get access to both libraries
Most games allow sharing 

Cons:
only one person can play at a time
Not all games allow sharing
If you leave a family, you can't join a new one for 365 days.

How it works:
You get a invite on steam to join. Once you accept it, you are in and have access to everything.
2024/10/14, 15:15 - Rowan: Not being able to play at the same time is a deal breaker 💀💀
2024/10/14, 15:16 - Aidan: why?
2024/10/14, 15:17 - Rowan: Girl when we call only 1 of us is gonna be able to play a steam game at a time
2024/10/14, 15:18 - Aidan: nononono
2024/10/14, 15:18 - Rowan: That's fine if I'm playing a steam game since you get your games from a million different sources, but girl I get everything off steam, I can't play if you're playing a steam game 😭

2024/10/28, 14:16 - Rowan: Otherwise thought they're not too bad
2024/10/28, 14:16 - Rowan: I don't think they do anything with dissertives in ig
2024/10/28, 14:16 - Aidan: a
2024/10/28, 14:16 - Aidan: idk
2024/10/28, 14:18 - Rowan: Sorry, not a dissertive, a discriminant
2024/10/28, 14:18 - Rowan: 💀
2024/10/28, 14:18 - Aidan: <Media omitted>
2024/10/28, 14:18 - Aidan: 💀
2024/10/28, 14:18 - Rowan: Gotta love those ❤️
2024/10/28, 14:18 - Aidan: fr 😭
2024/10/28, 14:20 - Aidan: mate is talking abt trig
2024/10/28, 14:20 - Aidan: I haven't done trig
2024/10/28, 14:20 - Rowan: Trig's so fun
2024/10/28, 14:20 - Rowan: But if you don't get it it's hell
2024/10/28, 14:20 - Rowan: And the graphs are hard
2024/10/28, 14:20 - Aidan: like anything in math
2024/10/28, 14:20 - Aidan: or cs
2024/10/28, 14:20 - Rowan: Ig 😭
2024/10/28, 14:20 - Aidan: this part i mean
2024/10/28, 14:20 - Rowan: Ye i got it
2024/10/28, 14:21 - Aidan: idk when i do it
2024/10/28, 14:21 - Rowan: I imagine near the end of the syllabus
2024/10/28, 14:21 - Aidan: yea
2024/10/28, 14:21 - Aidan: mby
2024/10/28, 14:21 - Aidan: <Media omitted>
2024/10/28, 14:21 - Aidan: makes sense
2024/10/28, 14:23 - Aidan: <Media omitted>
2024/10/28, 14:23 - Rowan: Wait until they ask you to find the derivative of 5x^2 + 42x + 69 and find the coordinate of it's turning points without graphing it
2024/10/28, 14:24 - Aidan: lmao
2024/10/28, 14:24 - Aidan: that's wild
2024/10/28, 14:24 - Aidan: IG or AS or A?
2024/10/28, 14:24 - Rowan: Ig 💀 💀
2024/10/28, 14:24 - Aidan: aw hell nah
2024/10/28, 14:25 - Rowan: I mean, it's a conditional function, but as far as I'm aware those aren't in the Cambridge syllabus? 💀
2024/10/28, 14:25 - Aidan: <Media omitted>
2024/10/28, 14:25 - Aidan: a
2024/10/28, 14:26 - Aidan: why i learn it den 😭
2024/10/28, 14:26 - Rowan: Girl, click off this video, this ain't cambridge 💀🙏
2024/10/28, 14:26 - Aidan: it is thou 😭
2024/10/28, 14:26 - Rowan: Wasn't in the syllabus I did 😭
2024/10/28, 14:26 - Aidan: <Media omitted>
2024/10/28, 14:26 - Rowan: Has the syllabus changed?
2024/10/28, 14:26 - Rowan: Girl this is khan academy

2024/10/28, 14:26 - Aidan: mby
2024/10/28, 14:27 - Aidan: yea edu anywhere uses other vids

2024/10/28, 14:27 - Aidan: idk
2024/10/28, 14:27 - Aidan: <Media omitted>
2024/10/28, 14:27 - Rowan: That's all good, all in the syllabus, what those videos are teaching you are not 😭
2024/10/28, 14:28 - Rowan: Girl ok wait
2024/10/28, 14:28 - Rowan: Go to Cambridge website and check the site's official mathematics learning objectives
2024/10/28, 14:28 - Rowan: Those'll tell you exactly what you need to know for the exam
2024/10/28, 14:28 - Aidan: i'll skip for now
2024/10/28, 14:29 - Aidan: ok but like
2024/10/28, 14:29 - Aidan: Bella wrote LO right
2024/10/28, 14:29 - Aidan: these were the toppics
2024/10/28, 14:29 - Aidan: <Media omitted>
2024/10/28, 14:30 - Rowan: Do you have a finch goal that says "talk abt girlfriend absolutely out of the blue no matter the context of the conversation" 😭😭
2024/10/28, 14:30 - Aidan: nah 😭
2024/10/28, 14:30 - Rowan: Don't take that the wrong way, there's nothing wrong with it, but that pivot's crazy 😭😭
2024/10/28, 14:31 - Rowan: Yep, sounds like LO
2024/10/28, 14:31 - Aidan: yea i got bored 🤨
2024/10/28, 14:31 - Aidan: 💀
2024/10/28, 14:31 - Aidan: why did :sk
2024/10/28, 14:31 - Aidan: type 🤨
2024/10/28, 14:31 - Aidan: skeptical
2024/10/28, 14:31 - Aidan: 😭
2024/10/28, 14:31 - Rowan: My comrade, please take a moment to articulate yourself and try again
2024/10/28, 14:31 - Aidan: nah
2024/10/28, 14:31 - Aidan: I'm good
2024/10/28, 14:31 - Aidan: back to the topic

2024/10/28, 14:32 - Rowan: 💀
2024/10/28, 14:32 - Rowan: That's p par for the course e
2024/10/28, 14:32 - Rowan: Back before silveroaks montessori went to Cambridge, the grade 7's did caps for a year, and they did LO
2024/10/28, 14:32 - Rowan: It's literally all just nonsense 😭
2024/10/28, 14:32 - Aidan: nah
2024/10/28, 14:32 - Aidan: it seems
2024/10/28, 14:32 - Aidan: wild
2024/10/28, 14:32 - Aidan: like
2024/10/28, 14:33 - Aidan: bruh
2024/10/28, 14:33 - Aidan: unhealthy sexual behaviors 😭
2024/10/28, 14:33 - Aidan: like
2024/10/28, 14:33 - Aidan: she 15 bro
2024/10/28, 14:33 - Aidan: Teenage pregnancy is real so I get that
2024/10/28, 14:33 - Aidan: but like
2024/10/28, 14:33 - Rowan: Caps kids learn abt that when they're 13
2024/10/28, 14:33 - Aidan: omds
2024/10/28, 14:34 - Rowan: <Media omitted>
2024/10/28, 14:34 - Aidan: anyways 💀
https://youtu.be/zTP_pEOmx-o
2024/10/28, 14:35 - Aidan: omds the awkwardness
2024/10/28, 14:35 - Aidan: aaiiii
2024/10/28, 14:35 - Aidan: poor dude
2024/10/28, 14:35 - Aidan: yk how I learnt abt sex?
2024/10/28, 14:35 - Aidan: FIVEEE 😭
2024/10/28, 14:36 - Rowan: I'm actually curious, I imagine your mom just told you but how 😭
2024/10/28, 14:36 - Aidan: otw home from school a friend told me
2024/10/28, 14:36 - Aidan: lmao
2024/10/28, 14:36 - Aidan: NAH
2024/10/28, 14:36 - Aidan: neva
2024/10/28, 14:36 - Aidan: she was with
2024/10/28, 14:36 - Aidan: and he had permission
2024/10/28, 14:36 - Aidan: but like
2024/10/28, 14:36 - Aidan: it was so rando
2024/10/28, 14:36 - Rowan: Ohh 💀 💀
2024/10/28, 14:36 - Rowan: Fair ig
2024/10/28, 14:36 - Rowan: That's crazy
2024/10/28, 14:36 - Rowan: But you had to find out eventually ig
2024/10/28, 14:37 - Aidan: idk maybe the lo topics seem wild for me cause I don't do lo
2024/10/28, 14:37 - Aidan: frfr
2024/10/28, 14:37 - Rowan: Yeah prob
2024/10/28, 14:37 - Aidan: not in grade... um... uhh... hmm... 4?
2024/10/28, 14:37 - Rowan: Yk no ones actually ever had a constructive chat about it with me, I've kind of just figured it all out over the years 😭😭
2024/10/28, 14:37 - Rowan: Oh chole, yeah maybe no
2024/10/28, 14:37 - Aidan: 😭
2024/10/28, 14:37 - Aidan: crazy
2024/10/28, 14:37 - Aidan: yeaaaa
2024/10/28, 14:37 - Aidan: a bit wild
2024/10/28, 14:38 - Rowan: But ig the earlier you learn the quicker you can adapt to that particular aspect of life in a healthy way
2024/10/28, 14:39 - Aidan: <Media omitted>
2024/10/28, 14:39 - Aidan: a
2024/10/28, 14:39 - Aidan: ig lol
2024/10/28, 14:39 - Aidan: wth is this
2024/10/28, 14:39 - Rowan: The hell is that
2024/10/28, 14:39 - Aidan: cubic functions
2024/10/28, 14:39 - Rowan: Is that a cubic formula 💀😭
2024/10/28, 14:39 - Aidan: yea
2024/10/28, 14:39 - Rowan: Wow can't believe I got that
2024/10/28, 14:40 - Aidan: lmao
2024/10/28, 14:40 - Rowan: It kinda looks like the quadratic formula on steroids
2024/10/28, 14:40 - Aidan: omds that funny
2024/10/28, 14:40 - Aidan: https://youtu.be/zTP_pEOmx-o?t=113
2024/10/28, 14:41 - Aidan: wth
2024/10/28, 14:41 - Aidan: is
2024/10/28, 14:41 - Aidan: that
2024/10/28, 14:41 - Aidan: intergration
2024/10/28, 14:41 - Aidan: me
2024/10/28, 14:41 - Aidan: <Media omitted>
2024/10/28, 14:41 - Rowan: Oh no, I remember those
2024/10/28, 14:41 - Aidan: keep looking
2024/10/28, 14:41 - Rowan: <Media omitted>
2024/10/28, 14:41 - Aidan: till you get this
2024/10/28, 14:42 - Rowan: Nah, idek what that curvy thing is, my brain's not that big
2024/10/28, 14:42 - Aidan: a cursive f 😭
2024/10/28, 14:42 - Rowan: 💀 💀
2024/10/28, 14:43 - Rowan: It looks like you're trying to find the derivative of a ratio function? 💀
2024/10/28, 14:43 - Aidan: idk
2024/10/28, 14:43 - Aidan: but look at the vid and till he shows that eq
2024/10/28, 14:43 - Rowan: My guess would be:
1
----
5x^4
2024/10/28, 14:43 - Rowan: O ok
2024/10/28, 14:43 - Aidan: hahahaha
2024/10/28, 14:44 - Aidan: no
2024/10/28, 14:46 - Rowan: Damnnn lmao I see
2024/10/28, 14:47 - Aidan: yeaaa
2024/10/28, 14:47 - Aidan: no
2024/10/28, 14:47 - Aidan: i dont wanna
2024/10/28, 14:47 - Rowan: It would be fun if I knew what to do lmao
2024/10/28, 14:47 - Rowan: I like long questions
2024/10/28, 14:47 - Aidan: na 😭
2024/10/28, 14:54 - Aidan: composite funcs
2024/10/28, 14:54 - Aidan: here I come
2024/10/28, 14:54 - Aidan: also
2024/10/28, 14:55 - Aidan: our topics switch like someone with DID
2024/10/28, 14:55 - Aidan: (Dissociative Identity Disorder)
2024/10/28, 14:55 - Rowan: 💀💀
2024/10/28, 14:56 - Rowan: in the textbook I had it was nice, they cycle through arithmetic, algebra, geometry, statistics, and graphs and get progressively harder
2024/10/28, 14:56 - Rowan: its a good structure
2024/10/28, 14:57 - Aidan: and
2024/10/28, 14:57 - Aidan: f(g(2))
2024/10/28, 14:57 - Aidan: when
2024/10/28, 14:57 - Aidan: f(x) = x^2 - 1
2024/10/28, 14:58 - Rowan: and what's g lmao
2024/10/28, 14:58 - Aidan: another func
2024/10/28, 14:58 - Aidan: doesn't need to be f
2024/10/28, 14:58 - Rowan: ik, whats the function
2024/10/28, 14:58 - Aidan: o wait
2024/10/28, 14:59 - Aidan: f | g(t)
1 | 3
2 | -3
3 | 4
4 | -1
2024/10/28, 14:59 - Rowan: w-
2024/10/28, 14:59 - Aidan: w?
2024/10/28, 14:59 - Rowan: by the looks of it its:
if x is odd, x + 2
if x is even, x - 5
2024/10/28, 15:00 - Aidan: it's 8
2024/10/28, 15:00 - Aidan: cause
2024/10/28, 15:00 - Rowan: nah im so confused
2024/10/28, 15:00 - Aidan: f(g(2))

g(2) = -3

f(-3) = -3^2 - 1

 = 8
2024/10/28, 15:01 - Rowan: no chile, I was tryna figure out what g's formula is 😭
2024/10/28, 15:01 - Aidan: og
2024/10/28, 15:01 - Aidan: idk
2024/10/28, 15:01 - Rowan: it cant be x + 2
2024/10/28, 15:01 - Aidan: 3, -3, 4, -1
2024/10/28, 15:01 - Rowan: i think x - 5 is right though
2024/10/28, 15:01 - Aidan: nah
2024/10/28, 15:02 - Aidan: <Media omitted>
2024/10/28, 15:02 - Aidan: graph help?
2024/10/28, 15:02 - Rowan: not in the slightest ❤️
2024/10/28, 15:02 - Rowan: bro thats a different function, the hell is going on 😭😭
2024/10/28, 15:03 - Aidan: how abt
2024/10/28, 15:03 - Aidan: h(g(f(2)))
2024/10/28, 15:04 - Aidan: https://youtu.be/wUNWjd4bMmw here
2024/10/28, 15:04 - Aidan: see for your self
2024/10/28, 15:04 - Rowan: yeah that might help
2024/10/28, 15:04 - Aidan: this is -1 btw
2024/10/28, 15:04 - Rowan: if the function wasn't conditional the sequence equation would be: 0.5n + 2.5
2024/10/28, 15:05 - Rowan: actually, by that logic:
if x is odd, x = 0.5x + 2.5
if x is even, x = x - 5
2024/10/28, 15:06 - Aidan: is

1/0 = +- infinity?
2024/10/28, 15:07 - Rowan: depends on who you ask lma-
2024/10/28, 15:07 - Aidan: lol
2024/10/28, 15:07 - Aidan: cause like
2024/10/28, 15:07 - Aidan: 1/.1 is 10
2024/10/28, 15:07 - Rowan: imo, 1/0 = 0 but i have no proof
2024/10/28, 15:07 - Aidan: and on and on
2024/10/28, 15:07 - Aidan: nah
2024/10/28, 15:07 - Aidan: cause
2024/10/28, 15:07 - Aidan: 1/1 = 1
2024/10/28, 15:07 - Aidan: 1/.5 = 2
2024/10/28, 15:07 - Rowan: wait that's an interesting point
2024/10/28, 15:07 - Aidan: and so on
2024/10/28, 15:07 - Aidan: https://youtu.be/ydLTfyXaQmU
2024/10/28, 15:07 - Aidan: source ^
2024/10/28, 15:07 - Rowan: 1 * 10^infinity
2024/10/28, 15:08 - Rowan: yeah i get your point, its possible
2024/10/28, 15:08 - Aidan: yea
2024/10/28, 15:08 - Rowan: but then again, 1 and 0 are opposites, and by that logic they'd neutralize each other since 0 is anti-1, leaving nothing, therefore 0
2024/10/28, 15:08 - Rowan: so like i said, depends on who you ask 😭
2024/10/28, 15:09 - Aidan: the thing is
2024/10/28, 15:09 - Aidan: -∞ = +∞ = ∞
2024/10/28, 15:09 - Aidan: also
2024/10/28, 15:09 - Aidan: ∞+1 is stupid
2024/10/28, 15:09 - Aidan: cause
2024/10/28, 15:10 - Aidan: ∞+1 = ∞
2024/10/28, 15:10 - Aidan: <Media omitted>
2024/10/28, 15:10 - Rowan: wait i  haven't watched the vid but i don't think that's true, different infinities can be bigger than each other 😭😭
2024/10/28, 15:10 - Aidan: nah
2024/10/28, 15:10 - Aidan: why?
2024/10/28, 15:10 - Aidan: infinity is infinite
2024/10/28, 15:10 - Aidan: so 1 added to infinity is still infinity
2024/10/28, 15:11 - Rowan: idk man, infinity sciences are weird, but infinity^2 is bigger than infinity i think
2024/10/28, 15:11 - Aidan: why thou
2024/10/28, 15:11 - Aidan: that's like saying 1^2 is bigger than 1^3
2024/10/28, 15:11 - Rowan: that's true ig, but 1 + 1 = 2
2024/10/28, 15:11 - Rowan: and infinity + 1 is not 2
2024/10/28, 15:12 - Aidan: watch the vid XD
2024/10/28, 15:12 - Rowan: yeah chile lemme do that
2024/10/28, 15:12 - Aidan: yea but infinity is infinite
2024/10/28, 15:12 - Aidan: so
2024/10/28, 15:12 - Aidan: it is the biggest number
2024/10/28, 15:12 - Aidan: there is no bigger
2024/10/28, 15:12 - Aidan: so
2024/10/28, 15:12 - Aidan: ∞+1 is the biggest num
2024/10/28, 15:12 - Aidan: and so is ∞^2
2024/10/28, 15:12 - Aidan: and ∞^81249127481
2024/10/28, 15:19 - Rowan: i get your point
2024/10/28, 15:19 - Aidan: yea
2024/10/28, 15:19 - Rowan: but like, idk if that's true lo-
2024/10/28, 15:20 - Aidan: ?/0 is undefined
2024/10/28, 15:20 - Aidan: so
2024/10/28, 15:20 - Aidan: no one has figured it out
2024/10/28, 15:20 - Aidan: like sqr(-1) was undefined always
2024/10/28, 15:20 - Aidan: now it's not
2024/10/28, 15:20 - Rowan: ik, but idk if this specific definition is correct 😭
2024/10/28, 15:20 - Aidan: wdym
2024/10/28, 15:20 - Rowan: it's not a satisfying conclusion to come to, that infinity just absorbs everything
2024/10/28, 15:21 - Aidan: yea
2024/10/28, 15:21 - Aidan: idk
2024/10/28, 15:21 - Rowan: maybe let's have this conversation when I've studied math further and i, perhaps, have a phd
2024/10/28, 15:21 - Aidan: lol yea good ide
2024/10/28, 15:21 - Rowan: for now i don't understand numbers enough to have a proper discussion lmaoo
2024/10/28, 15:21 - Aidan: wanna call in like 5 min

2024/11/21, 11:23 - Aidan: they said 16+ can take whoever
2024/11/21, 11:23 - Aidan: becuase of space
2024/11/21, 11:23 - Aidan: but I assume they made arrangements

2024/11/21, 11:24 - Aidan: not any 16+
2024/11/21, 11:24 - Aidan: so a 16+ homeschooler can bring anyone
2024/11/21, 11:25 - Rowan: But kealley's ho- OK actually I don't want to do this, they made arrangements either way
2024/11/21, 11:25 - Aidan: kealley's ho?

2024/12/06, 19:59 - Aidan: Good good

But it's good
2024/12/06, 20:00 - Rowan: 💀 Like, are the wallpapers what you're looking for?
2024/12/06, 20:01 - Aidan: Yea there are tons
2024/12/06, 20:01 - Aidan: I'll show you sometime
2024/12/06, 20:01 - Rowan: Cool cool
2024/12/06, 20:01 - Aidan: And you can make your own
2024/12/06, 20:01 - Aidan: Lol
2024/12/06, 20:08 - Rowan: Does it give you like an in-built creator or does that just mean you can upload
2024/12/06, 20:20 - Aidan: Inbuild
2024/12/06, 20:41 - Rowan: Oo that's cool
2024/12/07, 16:14 - Rowan: Yayayyayay
2024/12/07, 16:20 - Aidan: Yesir
2024/12/08, 08:20 - Aidan: Yoo. I need some opinions. Imma buy myself a nice main monitor and 2 side monitors. I want all the monitors to be the same brand thou.

For the main I'm looking at this:
https://www.evetech.co.za/viewsonic-vx3218-pc-mhd/best-deal/11627.aspx

And for the sides there is a R1.5k one, but its 19 inch 💀
So I'm looking at this:
https://www.evetech.co.za/viewsonic-27-vx2779-hd-pro-180hz-gaming-monitor/best-deal/20608.aspx

Do you guys think it's a good idea? Anyone have any monitor suggestions? Also i noticed that my side monitors will have a higher refresh rate than my main 😂
But if i want i can just set them to be 165 too to make it the same
2024/12/08, 08:20 - Aidan: Gm btw
2024/12/08, 08:20 - Rowan: Good morningg
2024/12/08, 08:21 - Rowan: I'll checky this out a bit later
2024/12/08, 08:22 - Rowan: But initial impressions: extra monitors are very useful, but 3 seems slightly excessive to me, I think 2 monitors is p satisfactory for most purposes, but then again idk maybe the 3rd has benefits that I haven't seen
2024/12/08, 08:24 - Rowan: And also I think its a bit scuffed to have the monitors at different sizes but you'd probably get used to it over time 😭
2024/12/08, 08:24 - Rowan: Idk, I think this honestly comes to personal preference and how you plan on using it
2024/12/08, 08:25 - Rowan: If you plan on having games on your main monitor and then having maybe schoolwork or code editor on the extra monitor(s) then personally I think 2 is enough
2024/12/08, 08:26 - Rowan: But, like, maybe you want a YouTube vid on the third or something? That kinda sounds like a waste to me though 💀
2024/12/08, 08:26 - Aidan: Oke
2024/12/08, 08:27 - Aidan: Nuh uh the amount of monitors is not gonna change 😭😭
2024/12/08, 08:27 - Aidan: Wdym?
2024/12/08, 08:27 - Aidan: Yea so basically I'll show you my setup now
2024/12/08, 08:28 - Rowan: Nvm, I was under the assumption that the main monitor was a different size because of your message but that appears to not be the case
2024/12/08, 08:29 - Aidan: It is lol
2024/12/08, 08:29 - Aidan: Main is 32 inch
2024/12/08, 08:29 - Aidan: Side is 27 inch
2024/12/08, 08:30 - Rowan: Ohh so the difference isn't too bad
2024/12/08, 08:30 - Rowan: Nevermind that comment then

2024/12/23, 20:54 - Aidan: Yup
2024/12/23, 20:54 - Rowan: what's your opinion on sza

2024/12/23, 20:54 - Aidan: I don't listen to her sk
2024/12/23, 20:55 - Aidan: Do
2024/12/23, 20:55 - Aidan: So
2024/12/23, 20:55 - Rowan: i see
2024/12/24, 02:16 - Aidan: Yo, i just finished Before your eyes
2024/12/24, 02:17 - Aidan: An absolute masterpiece.

The game takes around 1.5h to complete (so basically a movie) and is worth every second. It leaves you wishing you didn't blink in some places (which was very difficult to do with tear filled eyes) and feeling the need to go back and change your choices. I will most definitely be replaying this gem and choosing the other options (and 100%ing it). I think the parts that hit me the hardest were the cats dying, the mom dying and seeing the real story

Had to get my blinking fixed like 12 times (that's my camera's fault) lmao, but definitely better with blinking mechanics.

10/10 game, will be replaying soon. <This message was edited>
2024/12/24, 09:01 - Rowan: Agreed hunnid percent
2024/12/24, 09:02 - Rowan: I didn't have any problems with the blinking mechanic and I had glasses on so yeah it's prob just your camera
2024/12/24, 12:43 - Aidan: ye i used my phone lmao

2024/12/24, 16:56 - Rowan: Looks interesting
2024/12/24, 17:54 - Aidan: Yer
2024/12/24, 20:35 - Aidan: It docks at the bottom or side, depending on what you choose (can't change mid game, you choose when you start)

I did not buy it (like i do...) but i think i will when i get funds lmao


First, imma buy 2 more of the monitor i got (cause it's R3k(sale) and 27" (you can't find 27" 60hz ViewSonic lmao))

2024/12/25, 08:55 - Rowan: Anyway, I should probably also make instructions on how to build it, I may have overcomplicated the process
2024/12/25, 08:55 - Aidan: Eish yea 😭
2024/12/25, 08:55 - Rowan: The normal's silencer has those weird dents in it, the silverballer's didn't
2024/12/25, 08:55 - Aidan: Oh?

2024/12/28, 23:05 - Aidan: My opinion on Galdiator:

There was really bad camera work at times
Unnecessary slow mo?
Unnecessary amounts of blood. So much it's obviously fake. Like it sprays 😭💀

Otherwise good movie
8.5/10
2024/12/29, 08:53 - Rowan: Plot twist: they're all wants 🙏

2024/12/29, 11:01 - Rowan: Cool
2024/12/29, 11:01 - Rowan: Maybe I'm confused on the role of a ups
2024/12/29, 11:01 - Aidan: Wanna hop on a* 😭

2025/01/16, 07:56 - Rowan: nahh
2025/01/16, 07:56 - Aidan: happens every vid bro he so clumsy 😭
2025/01/16, 07:57 - Aidan: <Media omitted>

2025/01/16, 07:57 - Aidan: eish idk bro iwl 😭
2025/01/16, 07:57 - Aidan: it sometimes breaks soo
2025/01/16, 07:57 - Rowan: yoh

2025/01/16, 07:59 - Rowan: yeah, ima give it a few mins to deal with traffic
2025/01/16, 07:59 - Aidan: fair fair
2025/01/16, 10:29 - Aidan: Should we try a getfixedboi run sometime?
2025/01/16, 11:31 - Rowan: Dude we have to finish our other run 😭
2025/01/16, 12:18 - Aidan: That's why i said sometime 😭
2025/01/16, 12:25 - Rowan: sometime after the other run, yes lmaoo
2025/01/16, 13:22 - Aidan: Lol
2025/01/16, 13:25 - Aidan: <Media omitted>
2025/01/16, 13:26 - Rowan: just convert them both to positive binary, then use the flip and add one method on 27 and then just add them normally
2025/01/16, 13:26 - Rowan: and use 2's complement on the final answer
2025/01/16, 13:26 - Aidan: Ooo ok cool
2025/01/16, 13:26 - Rowan: i think the answer to 2's wrong because there's overflow, or maybe not
2025/01/16, 13:26 - Aidan: But why
2025/01/16, 13:27 - Aidan: But how do you convert -27 to pos?
2025/01/16, 13:28 - Aidan: O wait
2025/01/16, 13:28 - Aidan: Stupid me
2025/01/16, 13:28 - Rowan: idek what's going on with d lmaooo
2025/01/16, 13:28 - Rowan: lemme check what i said
2025/01/16, 13:28 - Rowan: OHH
2025/01/16, 13:29 - Aidan: Wait the flip add thing
2025/01/16, 13:29 - Aidan: How do again
2025/01/16, 13:29 - Rowan: it's 2's complement format and it exceeds the limit of what 2's complement can store because it can only store from 127 - -128
2025/01/16, 13:29 - Rowan: flip each 0 to a 1 and then add 1 to the product of that
2025/01/16, 13:30 - Aidan: Ok but
2025/01/16, 13:30 - Aidan: Then i get
 00111100
-11100101
2025/01/16, 13:30 - Aidan: 0-
2025/01/16, 13:30 - Aidan: 0-1?

2025/01/16, 13:34 - Aidan: So?
2025/01/16, 13:34 - Aidan: Why is that wrong?
2025/01/16, 13:34 - Rowan: because both of those are positive numbers
2025/01/16, 13:34 - Rowan: the answer shouldn't be negative
2025/01/16, 13:34 - Aidan: Ooooooo

2025/01/21, 12:25 - Aidan: about my setup yk
2025/01/21, 12:25 - Aidan: I wanna make a desk at some point
2025/01/21, 12:25 - Aidan: like this :D https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_3NVXml470
2025/01/21, 12:25 - Aidan: not quite this
2025/01/21, 12:26 - Aidan: but basically a plank of wood with cable management slits in the back or smt like that
2025/01/21, 12:26 - Aidan: and maybe
2025/01/21, 12:26 - Aidan: just maybe
2025/01/21, 12:26 - Aidan: make it movable (up and down)
2025/01/21, 12:26 - Aidan: idk
2025/01/21, 12:26 - Rowan: my father could prob make that lmao
2025/01/21, 12:26 - Aidan: what part lmao
2025/01/21, 12:26 - Rowan: all of it
2025/01/21, 12:27 - Rowan: he's a carpenter in his spare time
2025/01/21, 12:27 - Aidan: moveable too? 😭
2025/01/21, 12:27 - Rowan: ye, he made an adjustable table for his table saw
2025/01/21, 12:27 - Aidan: ooo
2025/01/21, 12:27 - Aidan: https://karo.co.za/product/hilo-100-height-adjustable-standing-desk/
like this?
2025/01/21, 12:28 - Rowan: probably
2025/01/21, 12:28 - Aidan: daymm
2025/01/21, 12:28 - Rowan: but that's p simple, you kinda just make the sliding legs and put pinholes through it to set it at certain heights
2025/01/21, 12:29 - Rowan: at least, I think that's what this desk is doing
2025/01/21, 12:29 - Aidan: ooo you mean like thatt
2025/01/21, 12:29 - Aidan: makes sense
2025/01/21, 12:29 - Aidan: most standing desks have like a control thing to move it with a motor or smy
2025/01/21, 12:29 - Aidan: smt
2025/01/21, 12:29 - Rowan: my father's has variable heights, but the system he uses is janky since you have to use a drill to adjust the height lmaoo
2025/01/21, 12:29 - Rowan: i think he could prob make a simp[ler system though
2025/01/21, 12:29 - Aidan: eish lmao
2025/01/21, 12:29 - Aidan: I'm sure
2025/01/21, 12:30 - Rowan: he doesn't really work with motors, most of his systems are mechanical
2025/01/21, 12:32 - Aidan: nah what you said would work yea
2025/01/21, 12:33 - Aidan: I'll 3d model what I'm thinking of
2025/01/21, 12:33 - Rowan: oke doke
2025/01/21, 12:33 - Aidan: then once I'm done with it could you show it to him and possibly find out if he'd be down to make one sometime (not soon doe)
2025/01/21, 12:33 - Aidan: and how much it would cost and all
2025/01/21, 12:33 - Rowan: ye ill pitch to him
2025/01/21, 12:33 - Aidan: tyty
2025/01/21, 12:33 - Aidan: but once I'm done with the model XD
2025/01/21, 12:34 - Rowan: he's quite busy atm though, it'll be at least 3 months id say lmaoo
2025/01/21, 12:34 - Rowan: like before he has time to do anything like that
2025/01/21, 12:34 - Aidan: yeaaa I don't think b4 then either way lmao

2025/01/26, 19:36 - Rowan: It keeps you attached to that phase of your life in a way
2025/01/26, 19:36 - Rowan: Yeah no 💀
2025/01/26, 19:36 - Aidan: I can get that, but to me it sounds like hoarding 😭😭😭

2025/02/02, 19:16 - Rowan: yoh idk if you're gonna get cheaper than that
2025/02/02, 19:16 - Rowan: its a complicated product
2025/02/02, 19:17 - Rowan: like high-key just do a shelf, the arm would look cleaner but the shelf will do just fine and cost around a 5th of the cheapest arm you'll find
2025/02/02, 19:20 - Aidan: I will dw
2025/02/02, 19:21 - Aidan: Ehhh

2025/02/02, 19:47 - Aidan: Rly?
2025/02/02, 19:47 - Rowan: yeah idk that swivel doesn't look strong enough

Ok so this is exactly as long as it needs to be (460mm), which may not be optimal?
2025/02/02, 20:37 - Rowan: yeah idk
2025/02/02, 20:43 - Aidan: https://www.takealot.com/40-80-full-motion-cantilever-wall-mount-bracket-swivel-tilt/PLID94094376

This looks best
2025/02/02, 20:45 - Aidan: Also, you say i should wait to do stuff till we move, but our house has been in the market for i kid you not like 9 years
2025/02/02, 21:00 - Rowan: Eish
2025/02/02, 21:00 - Rowan: Fair
2025/02/03, 05:26 - Aidan: Actually nvm, it can't tilt 90 degrees
2025/02/03, 05:27 - Aidan: https://www.takealot.com/bontec-tv-wall-mount-75-bracket-long-articulated-arm-hdmi-spirit/PLID95254401
Seems like this is best
2025/02/03, 05:28 - Aidan: Ok but hear me our here.

How much does a good plank of wood cost? Add good wall mounts that can hold up a tv somehow? And possibly foot attachments for the tv? At that point you can just get a arm which will look much much better
2025/02/03, 05:28 - Aidan: Gm btw
2025/02/03, 07:00 - Aidan: Welp thay was an expensive and useless trip
2025/02/03, 07:55 - Rowan: Yeah fair
2025/02/03, 07:58 - Rowan: I actually asked my father and he agrees with you that an arm will be better 😭so I correct stranded there
2025/02/03, 07:59 - Rowan: He says he wants the TV specs and he can send you the right one since he has a lot of experience mounting tvs
2025/02/03, 07:59 - Rowan: Should've asked him sooner, sorre for giving kak advice lmaoo
2025/02/03, 08:19 - Aidan: Lmaooo npnp
2025/02/03, 08:20 - Aidan: Ooh? Ok, you can show him the last one i sent so long. It's a 40 inch tv (92cm wide) and i want the mount to be able to rotate 90° so it can come out of the wall on the side and still face my bed (yk what i mean?)
Any other specs needed?
2025/02/03, 08:20 - Rowan: he wanted weight too
2025/02/03, 08:20 - Aidan: We left home, drove almost all the way to tennis, got the message that squad is cancelled, came home
2025/02/03, 08:20 - Aidan: Oo ok, idk so I'll have to go find out
2025/02/03, 08:20 - Rowan: oeiii, that sucks
2025/02/03, 08:21 - Aidan: The arm i sent had 50kg max
2025/02/03, 08:21 - Rowan: oke, if you can't find a weight ill take him 50kg
2025/02/03, 08:28 - Aidan: Shap, less than 50 doe 😭😭
2025/02/03, 08:31 - Rowan: yeah definitely but its better to go bigger in most cases lmaoo
2025/02/03, 08:32 - Rowan: but anyway, he said if its 40 inch its not a problem, and he recommends this one:
2025/02/03, 08:32 - Rowan: https://www.takealot.com/doul-arm-thickened-wall-mount-bracket-for-32-80-inch-curved-and-/PLID94788814?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAzPy8BhBoEiwAbnM9O34Wvk_tNUJ7jOuM0kiojI1pfPHqwfVvSFGtL6YJASF6jXopJmR9JRoCv7EQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&gclsrc=aw.ds
2025/02/03, 08:33 - Rowan: this one'll be especially good if you wanna upgrade to sum bigger eventually
2025/02/03, 08:38 - Aidan: Haaibo 3.8 stars? <This message was edited>

2025/02/03, 08:39 - Rowan: idek man lmaoo
2025/02/03, 08:39 - Rowan: a lot of the low reviews are saying its a bit difficult and complicated to install
2025/02/03, 08:39 - Rowan: im assuming that a lot of the ones that say their tv fell off of it installed it incorrectly
2025/02/03, 08:40 - Aidan: The ones ive seen is saying it fell off
2025/02/03, 08:40 - Aidan: Hmaybe
2025/02/03, 08:40 - Rowan: they also had much bigger tvs though
2025/02/03, 08:41 - Rowan: im seeing a lot of people saying it's fine for smaller tvs but the bigger ones not so much
2025/02/03, 08:41 - Aidan: True
2025/02/03, 08:41 - Aidan: Yea idk maybe it's fine XD
2025/02/03, 08:42 - Aidan: Plus this isn't big enough doe?
2025/02/03, 08:42 - Rowan: is it not? you have a 40 inch dont you?
2025/02/03, 08:42 - Rowan: oh do you mean length-wise?
2025/02/03, 08:42 - Aidan: It goes out max 400mm
2025/02/03, 08:42 - Aidan: Yea
2025/02/03, 08:43 - Aidan: Needs to go out minimum 460
2025/02/03, 08:43 - Rowan: hmm

2025/02/17, 14:08 - Aidan: A dynamic-link library is a shared library in the Microsoft Windows or OS/2 operating system. A DLL can contain executable code, data, and resources. A DLL file often has file extension .dll even though this is not required. The extension is sometimes used to describe the content of the file.

2025/02/19, 12:00 - Rowan: that's not a problem with the marking, that's a problem with the specs of the program, which is the human-side
2025/02/19, 12:00 - Rowan: so it's not the smart mark thats stupid, its the person who designed it like that lmaoo

2025/03/16, 18:08 - Rowan: Yoo nice
2025/03/16, 18:08 - Aidan: Got it for R63 🙌🏼
2025/03/16, 18:08 - Aidan: And it's got family sharing
2025/03/16, 18:08 - Rowan: That's really good
2025/03/16, 18:11 - Aidan: Ikrr
2025/03/16, 18:53 - Aidan: Wel0
2025/03/16, 18:53 - Aidan: My mom doesn't like isaac
2025/03/16, 18:53 - Rowan: Oop, why?
2025/03/16, 18:53 - Aidan: What's your opinion on the game, gameplay and story wise
2025/03/16, 18:53 - Rowan: Haven't seen enough content on it to say
2025/03/16, 18:56 - Aidan: https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth
2025/03/16, 18:56 - Aidan: Check a bit
2025/03/16, 18:57 - Rowan: Girl you've played doom 😭
2025/03/16, 18:58 - Rowan: Ig it's fair if she thinks youre not ready for any topics surrounding abuse and suicide
2025/03/16, 18:59 - Aidan: Yea no exactly
2025/03/16, 18:59 - Aidan: "Gory game" ya sure
2025/03/16, 18:59 - Aidan: *tlou
2025/03/16, 18:59 - Rowan: 😭
2025/03/16, 18:59 - Rowan: You gonna refund?
2025/03/16, 19:00 - Aidan: Idk i gotta decide ig
2025/03/16, 19:01 - Aidan: It's the story that bothers her
2025/03/16, 19:02 - Aidan: "The game's title and plot are inspired by the Biblical story of the Binding of Isaac. In the game, Isaac's mother receives a message from God demanding the life of her son as proof of her faith, and Isaac, fearing for his life, flees into the monster-filled basement of their home where he must fight to survive."
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Binding_of_Isaac_(video_game)#:~:text=The%20game%27s%20title,fight%20to%20survive.
2025/03/16, 19:04 - Aidan: Idk what do u think, should i refund?
2025/03/16, 19:08 - Aidan: No wait, detroit
2025/03/16, 19:08 - Aidan: Mega detroit vibe there
2025/03/16, 19:16 - Rowan: It's your mother's choice lmaoo
2025/03/16, 19:16 - Aidan: Ye that's what you'd think, but she said i gotta decide
2025/03/16, 19:18 - Rowan: I mean, I'm operating from the perspective that if my parents don't like it then I have no choice but to ditch it, if you're operating outside of that framework I'd say it's really up to you - why exactly does you mother not like the game? Do you feel that you can engage with the darker themes in a mature and progressive way?
2025/03/16, 19:19 - Rowan: Like personally I'd eat this up because I love me a philosophical debate, but I also know my parents would probably rather take a bullet than let me play this game lma-
2025/03/16, 19:20 - Rowan: Idk, have the discussion with your mother and understand where she's coming from first
2025/03/16, 19:28 - Aidan: Eishhh
2025/03/16, 19:29 - Aidan: I have
2025/03/16, 19:29 - Aidan: I understand
2025/03/16, 19:29 - Aidan: Butt
2025/03/16, 19:29 - Aidan: It's a great game
2025/03/16, 19:29 - Aidan: It might help you to understand a bit about why the game was created. Ed has always said it was never to bash christainity, it was merely a tool for him. He was born to christian parents, but there was a lot of substance abuse problems in his family, he spent a lot of his childhood with his grandma because he didn't get on with his stepdad and he's talked before about religious trauma, religious guilt and a fear of sin, and he wanted to fight back against that. 

The game isn't about fighting against God, it was about fighting against a much more complex and twisted narrative his brain had learned at a young age, it just happened to look a little bit like christianity. 

His emotions aren't aimed at God or Jesus, they're aimed at a very twisted, false narrative of what christainity is. I don't believe the game itself to be blasphemous at all. Personal feelings on the matter may vary though, I guess it depends on how it resonates with each individual.
2025/03/16, 19:30 - Aidan: From reddit
2025/03/16, 19:35 - Rowan: That's what I assumed
2025/03/16, 19:35 - Rowan: Religious trauma isn't a result of God, it's a result of the people who twist the word of God to aid their own selfish gain
2025/03/16, 19:36 - Rowan: It's not a religiously polarising message imo
2025/03/16, 19:36 - Rowan: Also girl, this is a bad argument 😭the quality of the game is not in question, would you take a line of cocaine because it's the highest quality cocaine in the world?
2025/03/16, 19:38 - Rowan: The question here is: is it appropriate? In my opinion, yes, but if your mother disagrees, then understand why and if you disagree with her, then discuss it further if you can and have a constructive discussion
2025/03/16, 19:40 - Aidan: 💀💀💀
2025/03/16, 19:40 - Aidan: Yea... idk anymore
2025/03/16, 19:41 - Aidan: I was convince i want to
2025/03/16, 19:41 - Aidan: But
2025/03/16, 19:41 - Aidan: Idk
2025/03/16, 19:41 - Rowan: Then rather don't, wait until you're older
2025/03/16, 19:41 - Rowan: If you're not entirely convinced then I'd drop it
2025/03/16, 20:05 - Aidan: Hmm
2025/03/16, 20:05 - Aidan: I think i may just play it for a bit, then decine
2025/03/16, 20:05 - Aidan: Decide
2025/03/16, 20:07 - Rowan: I don't think you can engage with the themes if you only play it for a bit but ait 💀 <This message was edited>

2025/03/17, 21:02 - Aidan: And cross examine parts from different games 🥲
2025/03/17, 21:02 - Aidan: Aight XD
2025/03/17, 21:05 - Rowan: I think your music taste is p consistent
2025/03/17, 21:05 - Rowan: It's a combination of lesbian, basic and white rap

2025/03/17, 21:22 - Aidan: What's not basic then
2025/03/17, 21:22 - Rowan: Basic, and low-key lesbian because what the hell are they doing
2025/03/17, 21:23 - Aidan: Les??? Thats so straight 😭
2025/03/17, 21:23 - Aidan: They all guys
2025/03/17, 21:23 - Rowan: Wdymmmm are you colourblind 😭
2025/03/17, 21:23 - Aidan: 🥲
2025/03/17, 21:23 - Aidan: Maybe
2025/03/17, 21:23 - Aidan: Ok damn yea
2025/03/17, 21:23 - Aidan: I'm dum
2025/03/17, 21:23 - Rowan: The yearning in their music is so spiritually lesbian
2025/03/17, 21:23 - Aidan: 💀 you just yappin atp
2025/03/17, 21:24 - Rowan: Tyler the creator, metal, indie, rock, etc.
2025/03/17, 21:24 - Rowan: So are you ❤️
2025/03/17, 21:24 - Aidan: Brooo that's so subjective thou
2025/03/17, 21:24 - Rowan: Is it? 💀
2025/03/17, 21:25 - Rowan: I realise that green day is rock so I'll retract that statement
2025/03/17, 21:25 - Aidan: Yes, that's ur music tastes 😭
2025/03/17, 21:25 - Aidan: Exactlyyy
2025/03/17, 21:26 - Rowan: My music taste varies
2025/03/17, 21:26 - Rowan: I've had a basic phase
2025/03/17, 21:26 - Rowan: Rn I'm into hella pop
2025/03/17, 21:26 - Aidan: And that's not basic
2025/03/17, 21:27 - Rowan: I don't think rina sawayama and lady gaga is basic
2025/03/17, 21:28 - Aidan: Gaga is 🥲
2025/03/17, 21:28 - Aidan: And billie is? 😭
2025/03/17, 21:28 - Rowan: She's mainstream, not basic
2025/03/17, 21:28 - Aidan: Define basic
2025/03/17, 21:28 - Rowan: She's lesbian, not basic unless it's lunch or bad guy
2025/03/17, 21:29 - Rowan: Something that almost everyone likes and saying you like that tells me nothing about your music taste
2025/03/17, 21:29 - Aidan: U just say that cause bad guy is overplayed 😞
2025/03/17, 21:29 - Aidan: Hm
2025/03/17, 21:29 - Aidan: So
2025/03/17, 21:29 - Aidan: Mainstream
2025/03/17, 21:30 - Rowan: It's not overplayed, I just think it's very difficult to dislike that song 😭
2025/03/17, 21:30 - Aidan: It is cause of how much it was played at it's debut
2025/03/17, 21:30 - Rowan: I think it transcends mainstream because mainstream relies on trends
2025/03/17, 21:30 - Rowan: Fair, but everyone likes it so it's still basic
2025/03/17, 21:30 - Rowan: Unless they just say they hate it because, yes, overplayed
2025/03/17, 21:31 - Aidan: Ok but saying that cad is basic is just so wrong 😭😭
2025/03/17, 21:32 - Rowan: Fine, i was saying that for the sake of saying it
2025/03/17, 21:32 - Rowan: I still stand on the lesbian thing though
2025/03/17, 21:32 - Aidan: How abt happier than ever. Not a easy song to like for lots ik

2025/03/17, 21:32 - Rowan: Happier than ever isn't basic imo
2025/03/17, 21:33 - Aidan: Uh hu
2025/03/17, 21:33 - Aidan: So billie as a whole isn't basic then
2025/03/17, 21:33 - Aidan: Or les
2025/03/17, 21:33 - Rowan: Sza has a few basic songs, like good days or kill Bill, but her discography is super diverse and skilled
2025/03/17, 21:34 - Rowan: No as a whole she's lesbian
2025/03/17, 21:34 - Aidan: I mean, she is
2025/03/17, 21:34 - Aidan: But
2025/03/17, 21:34 - Rowan: But basic as a whole, no
2025/03/17, 21:34 - Rowan: Yeah I think she's overall p basic but she has some funny songs
2025/03/17, 21:34 - Aidan: Water
2025/03/17, 21:35 - Rowan: Waters basic
2025/03/17, 21:35 - Rowan: I'm thinking more the joburg song
2025/03/17, 21:35 - Aidan: Oo ya
2025/03/17, 21:35 - Rowan: That song's really funny imo
2025/03/17, 21:35 - Aidan: That one
2025/03/17, 21:36 - Aidan: Still feel like this is wrong doe
2025/03/17, 21:36 - Aidan: The variety
2025/03/17, 21:36 - Rowan: Idk it's easier to identify a song youd like than say, paige or entle

2025/03/24, 11:43 - Rowan: the gap's a bit long, cuz engineering week is 6 to 10th I believe
2025/03/24, 11:43 - Rowan: so that probably won't be viable

2025/04/15, 13:54 - Rowan: i see
2025/04/15, 13:54 - Aidan: I replaced it with mine
2025/04/15, 13:54 - Aidan: and it works
2025/04/15, 13:55 - Aidan: it's weird, cause when I hash out the 2nd func, it works, but when it's not hashed out, it broke
2025/04/15, 13:55 - Rowan: sho
2025/04/15, 13:56 - Aidan: why u using a procedure
2025/04/15, 13:56 - Rowan: idk

2025/04/15, 13:56 - Rowan: also dude i have no idea whats wrong with my delete comment function

2025/04/15, 13:57 - Aidan: Xd
2025/04/15, 14:02 - Rowan: it must've been something with how i assigned the new line lmaoo

2025/04/15, 14:03 - Aidan: never gets met
2025/04/15, 14:03 - Aidan: cause count <> LENGTH(line) is always true
2025/04/15, 14:04 - Rowan: ohh
2025/04/15, 14:04 - Rowan: i see
2025/04/15, 14:04 - Rowan: so ig id just add another parameter
